# Anki Statistics Extended

This Anki add-on adds a stacked bar chart to the stats view, showing the distribution of card statuses by tag. It categorizes cards into five native Anki types: **New**, **Learning**, **Relearning**, **Young**, and **Mature**, and colors them to match Ankiâ€™s default pie chart.

Tech: Python, Anki hooks, Plotly.js
